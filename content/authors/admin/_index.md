I am currently writing a Masters thesis for an MS in Computer Science, advised by Dr. Song-Chun Zhu at the Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy ([VCLA](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/projects.html)) at UCLA.

Before my Masters, I worked as a Full Stack Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area for almost three years, most recently at NatureBox.

My research interests are in generative modeling and multi-agent systems. I have contributed to several research projects that apply MCMC sampling and generative models to various vision and language tasks. Many projects are on my [Github](https://www.github.com/EricMFischer).
