I received my undergraduate degree at UCLA and am currently pursuing a MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, my focus is on generative modeling techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. My coursework at UCLA spans statistics, computer science, and electrical and computer engineering, and this Fall 2019 I am applying to PhD programs.
