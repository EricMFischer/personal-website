I am currently working on this paper while advised by Professor Song-Chun Zhu at the Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy at UCLA.

**Please note** this research and this paper are currently in progress and the title is tentative. The image above is taken from another [paper](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/TMM_Topic_Clustering_Tracking.pdf) at the Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy lab at UCLA to which I personally did not contribute.

More information will be posted here as this research and paper are finished.
